                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
                           
                            <p>Monkeys are primates found primarily in tropical rainforests. Most monkeys are arboreal, though some, like macaques and baboons, are terrestrial.      New World monkeys, like spider monkeys, tamarins, and capuchins, are found in Mexico and South and Central America, while Old World monkeys,          including baboons, gelada, and colobus, are found in Asia and Africa. Many species of monkeys are endangered. 
                           
                                The term "monkey" is sometimes used as a catch-all for every animal in the primate family, but the truth is that monkeys live on completely different branches of the evolutionary tree from both apes (i.e., chimpanzees, gorillas, and humans) and prosimians (i.e., lemurs, tarsiers, and lorises). 

                                One big difference between monkeys and other primates is in the tail: Most monkeys have tails, while apes and other primates do not. Apes also tend to be larger than monkeys and, thanks to their larger brains, more intelligent.
                           
                                Some of the most fascinating monkey species are experiencing rapid declines in population due to a variety of factors based on their unique location. The greatest risk factors include habitat loss and fragmentation, live capture for the global pet trade, and hunting for bushmeat or traditional medicines.</p>


                                <p>Many of the world’s monkeys are at risk. Several are included on the IUCN's list of the 25 most endangered primates. Some of the most critically endangered Old World monkeys include the roloway monkey, the Niger Delta red colobus, and Cat Ba langur; only 50 individuals of the latter remain.
                                New World monkeys that are critically endangered include the cotton-headed tamarin, the Ecuadorian white-fronted capuchin, and the pied tamarin.
                           
                                For monkeys, picking bugs, dirt, and other debris off their companions is far from an indictment of their personal hygiene — it's an expression of affection and love. Grooming rituals not only keep monkeys healthy, they also strengthen their social bonds.


                                Researchers discovered another benefit of grooming. When vervet monkeys comb each other’s pelt, it fluffs the fur and makes it thicker. After a thorough grooming, the insulation value of the vervet monkey’s pelt increases by as much as 50 percent.
                           
                           
                                Only New World monkeys in the Atelidae family, like howler monkeys and spider monkeys, and capuchins in the Cebidae family, have prehensile tails. These arboreal primates live in the tropical regions of Mexico, Central America, and South America. Old World monkeys, which live in Asia and Africa, have tails, but they are not prehensile.


                                In length and gripping ability, spider monkeys and howler monkeys have an edge on capuchins. Spider monkeys have tails that are longer than their entire bodies. Their tails are also hairless and have friction pads for better gripping.9﻿ Capuchins, which have hair-covered tails that are not nearly as long, primarily use their tails to grasp branches and carry fruit through the forest.
                           
                                Barbary macaques have the distinction of being the only wild nonhuman primates in Europe. While most Barbary macaques inhabit the mountains of Morocco and Algeria, a small population of around 200 individuals was introduced and is maintained in Gibraltar. DNA analysis shows that these macaques, which have been in Gibraltar for many centuries, were originally imported from Northern Africa.

                                Considered endangered in all parts of their range, the population of Barbary macaques has declined more than 50 percent over a period of 24 years.</p>
